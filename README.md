# MLBookcampCarPricePrediction2022
This project is based on the Car Price Prediction case study from the Machine Learning Bookcamp by Alexey Grigorev. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features like make, model, year, mileage, and more.

The problem we will solve in this repository is predicting the price of a car.

The plan for the project is the following:

First, we download the dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset
Next, we do some preliminary analysis of the data.
After that, we set up a validation strategy to make sure our model produces correct predictions.
Then we implement a linear regression model in Python and NumPy.
Next, we cover feature engineering - to extract important features from the data to improve the model
Finally, we see how to make our model stable with regularization and use it to predict car prices.
